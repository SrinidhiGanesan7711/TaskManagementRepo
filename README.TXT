This is a simple task manager program to add, update, delete, and view tasks. Each task has a description, deadline, status, and priority.
It uses SQLite to store tasks. By default, status is "pending" and priority is "medium." Users can search tasks by description, sort by deadline or status, and see tasks due soon.
To run install Python and run python main.py. The menu will guide you. 
Tasks with no deadline are NULL. Sorting works only by deadline or status.
